# JSONPowerDB

## Title of Project
Integration of JSONPowerDB with Form in HTML

## Description
- JsonPowerDB is a real-time, high performance, lightweight and simple to use, Rest API based multi-mode DBMS. 
- JsonPowerDB has ready to use API for Json document DB, RDBMS, Key-Value DB, GeoSpatial DB and Time Series DB functionality. 
- JPDB supports and advocates for true serverless and pluggable API development.

Here, I have mentioned a basic example of integration of JSONPowerDB with HTML by creating a sample form.
Whenever the information as mentioned inthe form is filled and submitted then the data is saved to the JPDB database.

## Benefits of using JSONPowerDB
1. Minimises the development cost
2. Time to market is minimised
3. Less complexity of iteroperability of different applications
4. Future tech driven since:
   - It fills gap from database to big data
   - It has user-defined API
   - It can adapt new algorithms easily
5. Minimum total cost of ownership
